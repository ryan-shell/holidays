# holidays
This repository contains a project that has an intial list of holidays called "Holidays.json" from this list
the program takes in those holidays and scrapes the web to collect additional holidays from the years 2020-2024.
with this information the user is able to view the holidays for a given week in a year and they can also
view the weather for that date if it is within 15 days of the current date. It does not handle previous dates only
future dates. This is because that is what the API supports. There were a few other API's that were available online but
as far as I could tell all of them required a subscription or some other form of payment to use.
